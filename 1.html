    We now know that assesment is wrong. At its lowest estimated fatality
    rate based on currnet data, Covid-19, the disease caused by
    the coronavirus, is thought to kill some 1-2% of known patients,
    compared to around 0.1% for winter influenza.
    The coronavirus also appears to be about as infections as the flu,
    and potentially more so, especially as there are no specific treatment,
    cure or seasonal vaccine.
